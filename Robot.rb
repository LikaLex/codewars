#Vicky is quite the small wonder. Most people don't even realize she's not a real
#girl, but a robot living amongst us. Sure, if you stick around her home for a
#while you might see her creator open up her back and make a few tweaks and even
#see her recharge in the closet instead of sleeping in a bed.
#In this kata, we're going to help Vicky keep track of the words she's learning.
#Write a function, learnWord(word) which is a method of the Robot object. The
#function should report back whether the word is now stored, or if she already
#knew the word.
#Example:
#Case shouldn't matter. Only alpha characters are valid. There's also a little
#trick here. Enjoy!



class Robot
  attr_accessor :words

  def initialize
    @words = ["do","input","not","thank","you","for","teaching","me", "i","already","know","understand","word","the"]
  end

  def learn_word(word)
    return "I do not understand the input" if word =~ /\W/ || word =~ /\d/ || word == ""
    return "I already know the word #{word}" if words.include? word.downcase
    words << word.downcase
    "Thank you for teaching me #{word}"
  end
